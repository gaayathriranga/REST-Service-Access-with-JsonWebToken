# REST-Service-Access-with-JsonWebToken
This is a small Python project that connects to a secured REST API and retrieves a list of transport records, such as trucks, ships, or airplanes. It does this by first requesting an access token (JWT â€“ JSON Web Token) using the provided client ID and secret. Once the token is received, the program uses it to call the API and fetch the transport data. Each transport item includes an ID, description, type, and timestamps for when the transport starts and ends. The script then prints this information to the screen. To run the project, you just need Python installed along with the requests library. After installing requests (using pip install requests), you can simply run the script from your terminal or command line. This project is mainly meant to show how secure API access with JWT works, and in a real-world scenario, it's recommended to keep secrets like client credentials out of the code.
